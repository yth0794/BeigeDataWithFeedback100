    "Essay_Prompt": "Nowadays, some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works of art by using a computer. To what extent you agree or disagree with this opinion?",
    "Essay": "Nowadays some people argue that public museums and art galleries will be replaced by online exhibitions including historical artifacts and works of art.  From my perspective, I do not totally agree with it. \n\nAdmittedly, there are some obvious advantage brought by digital platforms. The most noticeable benefit is to provide convenience and accseesibility without the limits of time and locations, especially for some visitor in remote areas. In other words, valuable collections of artifacts are often scattered in museums around the world. If you want to see all the historical objects and works of art, you must have a large amount of financial support and enough spare time. By contrast, you just need to View HD images on the museum's official website whenever you want. \n\nHowever, physical museums and art galleries have some indispensable traits. First and foremost, they provide a unique and immersive experience that digital platforms cannot fully replace. Standing in front of a masterpiece, and observing its texture, scale and real colors allow for a deeper appreciation of the artwork. For example, if you enjoy The Starry Night diaplayed in The Museum of Modern Art, the color of the painting is slightly distorted on the Internet, which is useless for a copyist to learn his oil painting techniques. In addition, visiting art institutions allow for personal interpretation and interaction. These institutions would offer spaces for dialogue, educational program, and even free guided tours where visitors can engage with knowledgeable staff and experts. This direct interaction forsters a deeper understanding of historical objects and artworks. \n\nIn conclusion, while digital art platforms bring convenience and accseesibility, physical museums and art galleries have a progressive and positive evolution on personal aesthetic enhancement and broadening the horizon.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people think lawbreakers should be sent to prison, while others think that alternatives to prison are more suitable, especially for minor offences. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.",
    "Essay": "The majority of criminals are always sent to prison no matter the scale of the crime. However, whether all the offences should have the prisonment or other suitable alternatives has become a controversial topic. Views on this topic vary considerably. \n\nIt is undeniable that the rehabilitation in jails presents clear advantages. First and foremost, the criminals would receive ideological education curriculums to improve their awareness of ideology and morality, which has a progressive and positive evolution on correcting their behaviors. In other words, the rehabilitation provides an opportunity for offenders to receive related job training and skills, allowing them to integrate into the society better.  Furthermore, the punishment of isolating an offender from society means that his behaviors against the laws do not disturb the peace of the society anymore and guarantee the citizens’ safety and well-being. \n\nHowever, the imprisonment cannot totally eliminate the crime and may even have some negative effect on minor offences. Making minor criminals spend months or years of their life with other hardened criminals is bound to turn them into career criminals; as a result, impressionable young people can easily get drawn into the wrong crowd. Another significant contributor of wearing away an individual’s self-respect and independence can not be ignored, making it less likely to achieve success after releasing. \n\nFrom my perspective, governments are supposed to take some alternatives to reduce crime rates and reform offenders, and this is mainly because prison may satisfy one’s sense of justice, but in fact, it serves as little constructive purposes. One the one hand, the government should enact the laws and policies, regulating that minor criminals could do community services or compulsory training courses. On the other hand, the imposition of a fine acts a simple penalty that avoid the disadvantages of many other forms of sentence, such as social discrimination and job loss. \n\nIn conclusion, I admit that the prison can bring some obvious benefits on society and citizens. By contrast, alternative penalties have a sustainable and holistic advantage on minor offenders’ future decelopment.",

    "Essay": "It is increasingly commonplace in contemporary society for individuals to establish their biases due to oversea trip instead of becoming open-minded. This essay will delve into the catalysts driving this shift and I will put forword my suggestions on it. \n\nAdmittedly, seceral factors contribute to psychological transformation. The most noticeable reason is tourtists do not always have sufficient time to fully immerse themselves in other local cultures due to the limited duration of their vacations. Consequently, people tend to interpret the customs and communities with their own knowledge and cultural heritage. To be more specific, they might rely on their superifical observations to make assumptions and judgments based on limited experiences, which may lead to misconceptions and stereotypes about an alien culture.  Meanwhile, another contributor of language barriers and their foreign identity also can not be ignored, which bring a lot of problem that can lead to the dislike of the native people. For instance, foreign tourtists are often ripped off to purchase the souvenirs and local commodities because of the misunderstanding of language. \n\nIn order to successfully address the worrying issue, the governments and individuals can work together to tackle this problem.  On the one hand, the government should enact the related laws and policies to eliminate unfair pricing. If the local resident sell their goods to foreigners above market price, the penalty will be imposed to them. It is also necessary for authorities to set up some compaigns to publicise the huge benefits that visitors bring to the local economic development. On the other hand, individuals should enhance their awareness of morality and ideology, which is beneficial to build a national image and attract more tourists. \n\nIn conclusion, while some factors resulting in biases deserve attention, I firmly believe that the local governments and citizens could take effective measures to cope with this issue.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative situation?",
    "Essay": "People in some countries consider owning a home to be more important than renting one. In this essay, I will explore the underlying reasons for this preference and elaborate on why it is a negative development.\n\nThere are two main reasons for people's preference for home ownership. First, for some people, owning a house or apartment provides a strong sense of security deeply in heart. because they would not worry about becoming homeless any more, while renters have to move from one to another due to various realistic factors. A case in point, youngsters who rent in metropolis are easier under bad mental health, like anxiety, depression, lack of belonging and so forth. Second, living in our own home tend to be more comfortable. As the owner, they have freedom to decorate room according to their taste and add a large number of furniture and applications, however, renters cannot live as well as that. Although people have the opportunity to improve the living condition, they must gain owner's permission at first and the money they spent on renovation is less likely to be compensate. \n\nThe trend that many people value home ownership over rented accommodation is negative due to the following reasons. The primary cause is that people separate a large part of income to save for mortgage, which leads to decreasing disposable income as well as lower quality of living standards. To illustrate, a survey conducted by economists revealed that citizens burden with mortgage reduce consumption in quantity and quality. Apart from that, this pressure force people to consider more reality rather than dare to challenge themselves. As they must keep a steady salary for mortgage, employees become so fear of risk that they try their best to avoid job changes. A real-life example is that many eligible and ambitious adults begin to stand unsatisfying leaders, unfair treatment and then gradually abandon career pursue after assuming the responsibility of home ownership.\n\nIn conclusion, although valuing home ownership has some sentimental and realistic reasons, this value may damage not only people's life quality but also the potential career development. All in all, this negative trend should not be encouraged publicly.",

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "Essay": "In a data-based society, information sharing has become more and more common as the fact that many valuable innovations and advancements are uploaded online to promote the whole world prosperity while part of them are secrecy. I agree that key technologies are so significant that they cannot be shared at random.\n\nThere are many advantages of sharing numerous information of science, finance, engineering, and such kind of fields. The main benefit is that knowledge and skills can be acquired by all people and applied by companies around the world which boosts the economy. A real life example can be seen from electric vehicle industry where Tesla as the pioneer of it opens all the intellectual properties which causes hundreds of manufacture ventures to emerge and the integration of the global industrial chain. Another benefit is that it contribute to the innovation because international talents are able to share their latest researching results and then do some study based on them which means that they avoid wasting large amount of time on already existed but not published technique. For instance, scientists are extremely keen on academic seminars for the most advanced study approaches that may help them overcome long-term difficulties.\n \nIt is necessary to protect valuable information from leaking out which is the results of scientists' hardworking and even a country's effort. Because many companies or groups consume hundreds of millions of dollars on a product and they need to be paid off by selling them at an expensive price. For example, worldwide governments approach laws and regulations to protect patents for decades of years with the purpose of encouraging people to create continuously. If everyone know the secrets and the product can be easily copied, the market will be in chaos and nobody want to pay a higher price for the same thing which even make creators go to bankrupt. Therefore, in competitive markets, unique scientific theories are the core to achieve business success and it is a wise choice not sharing them. \nAs far as I am concerned, whether these information can be shared freely or not depends on its significance and the owners' willingness. If the owners are glad to share it, then there is no problem. However, if the harms of sharing it outweigh the benefits, then it is better to keep it until a right time.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
    "Essay": "While reading online has become an extremely popular approach to get access to information, some people predict that practical magazines and books would be totally supplanted. From my perspective, printed reading materials are still needed by some people. In this essay, I will explore the underlying reasons of my thought and elaborate on why fully replacement is unrealistic.\n \nThere are two main reasons for people's preference for practical books and newspapers. The chief culprit is that electric screens hurt people's eyesight, especially for children and teenagers. For instance, although textbooks' content is available on the internet, most of schools require students to use printed textbooks to protect their eyes. Another key catalyst is that there are some people who cannot utilize internet to read, such as the elderly and the little children. It is obvious that these people rely on practical books and this kind of needs should not be neglected.\n \nIn real life, it is impossible for us to gain all the information on website for free. Firstly, a majority of papers and books are protected by intellectual property law, which means that public have to pay for them to read online. A typical example is that website membership fees are quite common when researchers visit professional platforms for latest papers. Secondly, there are a great deal of material for key technologies and data saved in printed way, which is only open to a small circle of people. So, the expectation to acquire everything is unrealistic.\n \nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that printed newspapers and book will exist in the future for the purpose of protecting eyesight as well as minority's need.

    "Essay": "Some people feel that advertisements are everywhere so that it is less likely to attract our eyes or influence our lives. Though to some extent it is true, I am in agreement with the sentiment that advertising still play a significant role on shopping options. \n \nThose who believe advertising records a dropping influence point out that those advertisements cannot arouse any interest from customers. From psychological perspective, if specific items expose too much, people's concentration lose and aversion grow. That's why television viewers choose to turn the program once they see the video ads on TV. Besides, it is understandable that people do not want to waste their time on useless information, particularly when internet users are compelled to watch these ads before gaining services. These advertisements tend to be regarded as a fixed procedure or even an obstacle, without attracting any buyers.\n\nAlthough, part of advertisements become invalid for boosting sales, some of them are still persuasive. The primary reason is that individuals are not sensible enough to resist ads temptation. Take skincare as an example, women prefer to buy them while believing its fictive effect claiming in ads rather than realizing the truth that the quality of skin is born. Apart from that, the advertising industry keep innovating over the decades.

    "Essay": "There is a widespread controversy about the benefits and drawbacks in terms of whether children should be educated to work diligently with the preposition of success. From my perspective, the potential negative impacts do not outweigh the positive influences by creating aspiration.\n \nThe legitimately worrying disadvantage to such education concerns neglection of various realistic factors. Children who have accepted this opinion through their growth tend to be idealistic, underestimate the level of difficulty, and lack understanding of underlying reasons. Another possible disappointing outcome is about mental health. Without probable anticipation, failures and obstacles may be overwhelming for them, leading to suspicion, confusion and depression.\n \nThe main advantages of this educational method is diligence. Since they firmly believe in themselves and the power of perseverance, children have determination to spend long time on their goals. Another benefit is the braveness facing an unknown future. Although all kids are unclear about where life direct them to, this belief provides confidence to go forward, convincing obstacles would be overcome by efforts.\n\nSkeptics insist on the possible adverse influence on logical and mental aspects. Despite the argument seeming plausibility, it fails to acknowledge young generation's resilience.

    "Essay": "Whether children should consume a vast amount of time on mobile phones has generated wide ranging controversy. In this essay, I will explore the underlying reasons of this current situation and explain why I consider it as a negative trend. \n\nThe chief culprit is the considerable attraction of the content and interaction of smartphones. This could be due to the captivating videos, information, games provided on a wide range of applications available on the digital device. Case in point, teenagers tend to spend most of their leisure time on browsing Youtuber, Tik Tok and Instagram for the purpose of relaxation and entertainment. Indulging themselves in mobile phones sometimes enables them to forget time pasting, playing for hours mindlessly. Another key catalyst is the lack of self-discipline when it comes to kids. This immersion on phones can attribute to the characteristic feature of this age, pursuing a sense of fun instead of prioritizing academic or career goals. To illustrate, intelligent algorithms are designed to recommend content according to kids' interests and preferences which children have difficulty with stop.\n\nI suppose spending considerable time on smartphones as a negative development. The primary reason for this is that it leads to a secondary lifestyle. People indulge themselves in playing video games, browsing short clips and interacting on social media instead of engaging in healthy activities such as hanging out with friends, reading books, exercising or taking up other worthwhile hobbies. To illustrate, as some TV news broadcasting, internet addicts can focus on screen for over 10 hours without sleep and diet. Such a deep addiction plays a harmful role on their physical and mental well-being, including decreasing eyesight, overwhelming spine, weaken physical strength, as well as, possible isolation from the social life.\n\nIn conclusion, this worrying phenomenon can stem from the attraction of internet content and the lack of self-discipline.

    "Essay": "These days some social issues have aroused public awareness of the importance of moral values. Reflections on this circumstance point to the lack of moral education while school merely focus on teaching knowledge and skills, thus I am in favor of adding this part to the school education.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional education system, there are several obstacles of implementing behavioral education. Firstly, it is less possible for teacher to observe and guide students’ daily behaviour at school. Due to the simple and single life scenes on campus, their qualities and movements are not exposed in the class. Without knowing basic information, teacher cannot provide sensible guidance according to their faults or mistaken practices. Apart from that, schools also face realistic problems, such as shortage of stuff, lack of relative resources and so forth. Forming good behaviour requires personal care, which means that a mentor should be responsible for no more than five students, as well as being professional in psychology. \n\nI presume school can assume this responsibility by making progress on some aspects. On the one hand, peer pressure is a useful tool to motivate their interest to admirable behaviour. Since those at young age value others’ evaluation, if teachers instill the significant moral values in their mind, they tend to follow these regulations to earn respect. On the other hand, this anticipation can be achieved by parents’ engagement. Schools can collaborate with parents by encouraging them to study positive outlook of life, identify rightness from wrongness, then correct their bad behaviour hand by hand. \n\nIn conclusion, though there are many practical problems making it hard to build well behaviour, school can make efforts on utilizing peer pressure and cooperation with parents.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.",
    "Essay": "Whether professionals should be limited to work in the country where they underwent their training has triggered a lively discussion. While some people support this idea, others argue. In this essay, I will explore both school of thought and lend support to the latter.\n\nOn the one hand, people who are in favor of this idea point out that these experts should contribute to the country which cultivates them. The primary reason is that building a professional require government's investment of money and resources. Take China as typical example, the tuition fees of university are cheap, which means that the real cost is far more than the money they pay. Needless to say, the nurture of a medical student also need an experienced doctor's one-on-one guidance which is priceless. As a result, if a learner receive professional training in one country but end up in working for another country, that causes waste and even to some extent.\n\nOn the other hand, others believe they have freedom to select which country to work in. A main factor is that it is unrealistic and impractical for government to limit their choice. In a globalized world, it is quite common for experts to learn and work in other countries for the purpose of technology advancement. For instance, mechanical engineers from Germany can access cutting-edge artificial intelligence in America, leading to a win-win combination between vehicle engineering and computer science.  \n\nPersonally, I strongly believe that professionals should be free to work in any country they wish. Although some people emphasize the contribution to the nation that trained them, it fails to consider the overall benefits to the world. In the long term, the regular flow of experts plays a significant role in technology innovations.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
    "Essay": "Nowadays a vast number of governments and corporations emphasize the importance of scientific research and development. Although this practice has become common sense for the public, there is a controversy about the aim of science. Some people hold the view that enhancing people's living standards should be considered as the most critical target of science. Personally, I disagree with this opinion.\n \nIt is true that improving people's living conditions is one of the key aspects in terms of the meaning of science. In fact, the convenience of modern transport, the widespread application of home appliances, and the availability of online learning resources are the benefits we enjoy as the result of technological advancement. However, we should acknowledge that these technological applications are developed based on previous considerable theoretical research. If we put the advantages of practical use in the first place, scientists in fundamental studying fields are possible to lose support and find it hard to continue. Apart from that, the normal process of science research in history is to explore unknown areas initially, try to find or develop new theories, then think of how to utilize them. It is short-sighted to believe the most significant purpose of science is to improve people's lives. \n\nThere are other aspects that should be prioritized when it comes to the aim of science, like uncovering the truth behind natural phenomena and satisfying humans' curiosity. Since it is our inherent nature to foster interest in unknown areas, prioritizing this pure purpose over calculating how much it would contribute to our lives is more likely to arouse our passion for science. As a result, researchers are more willing to enjoy the process when they dedicate time and energy to science, rather than feeling frustrated once the outcome fails to meet the expectation.  In addition, having a better understanding of nature does not benefit humans directly, but this knowledge can guide us in farming, planting, fishing, and so forth. \n \nIn conclusion, I disagree with the point that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. Because primarily driven by material interests, the passion for science is unsustainable in the long run.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Nowadays, a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?",
    "Essay": "Nowadays, due to environmental pollution and the lifestyle changes in modern society, there are an increasing number of people who suffer from health issues. After accepting regular treatment from their usual doctor for a long term, people start to seek for alternative means in order to improve their physical well-being. \n\nIt is understandable that most patients experience discomfort, hurt, frustration, and even desperation in the process of treatment. Especially when they cautiously follow the prescription of the usual doctor for several months and sometimes many years, but the effect of the medicine or the treatment is unsatisfying or useless. In this situation, if patients encounter or just hear about another method, they are likely to give it a try. In fact, there are indeed various medical ways although they do not belong the mainstream, like Chinese ancient herb medicines, Indian meditation treatment, traditional massage, and so forth. Even in terms of widely accepted Western medical system, differences exist in doctor's personal experience, medical methods, and technical levels. As a result, access to new medicines and treatment literally provides them opportunities to cure as well as hope in face of the disease. \n\nHowever, in most cases, these patients not only lack medical knowledge but also are mentally vulnerable to identify which alternative medicine or treatment is truly effective. Thus this weakness is easily utilized by potential cheaters in the process seeking for treatment. These cheaters or even businessmen cannot resist the temptation of money, so that they may exaggerate or even lie about the real medical effect of this treatment method. Take the elderly people as a typical example, the majority of them suffer from chronic diseases and the discomfort caused by falling organic functionality, leading to a relatively large proportion of them being cheated all their retiring money. We should also acknowledge that, as the medical study shows, more than 80% of disease symptoms cannot be released by any medical means. Therefore, the effect of medical healthcare is unfortunately limited.\n\nPersonally, although trying alternative medicines and treatments is reasonable to some extent, it overlooks the fact that most people are just cheated of money and end up in frustration. In conclusion, I think it is a negative trend primarily because this practice puts so many patients under threat of being cheated.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people think like that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "Essay": "Due to environmental pollution, climate change has become a problem that influences almost all aspects of our lives. Recently, there has been a discussion about how climate change impacts business. While some people believe that climate change could have a negative effect on business, others argue that it could create more business opportunities. In this essay，I will explore both views and lend support to the former.\n\nSome people believe that climate change could have a negative effect on business. The primary reason is that climate change has led to more and more dramatic weather conditions happening, like the abnormally high temperature and bitterly cold climate, frequent drought and flooding at the same time in separate areas on earth, unexpected snow and hail in spring and so forth. In this situation, machines cannot run very well because of great temperature changes, workers demand rest in scorching hot weather, and delivery has to stop due to icy or slippery roads. As a result, the normal production and transportation are interrupted heavily. Corporations have to suffer from increasing losses if they are unable to generate required goods on time, which is an unsatisfying outcome for operators.\n\nHowever, other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Firstly, for the sake of tackling the climate change problem as well as minimizing the influence of environmental pollution, governments enforce strict standards of emissions. For instance, China requires a lower level of carbon dioxide emissions in terms of all types of industries. Consequently, some companies find the hidden opportunities under the policy, developing relevant equipment that can dispose of the emissions. Secondly, some brands improve their brand image by emphasizing eco-friendly means of production and recycling systems. Taking advantage of these points in their advertisements allows them to promote selling and occupy market in the severe business competition.\n\nAlthough climate change indeed brings some business opportunities to some extent, this view overlooks that the core of this issue is to consider the overall influence of climate change. Personally, I think that only a small part of business can benefit from climate change, whereas a wider range of companies have to suffer. What's worse is that the negative effects of climate change are out of control. In conclusion, I am in favor of the opinion that climate change could have a negative effect on business.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Experts say older people were happier and healthier in the past because they did more exercise and spend more time with their family and friends whereas now many suffer loneliness and health problems. What are the causes for this and what could be the solutions?",
    "Essay": "Although economy and technology have advanced dramatically, it seems like that the following changes in terms of lifestyles put elderly people in a dilemma. While in the past the elderly had more opportunities to do exercise and spend quality time with family and friends, nowadays many feel a strong sense of isolation and face health issues. In this essay, I will explore the underlying reasons and offer several effective solutions.\n \nWhen it comes to loneliness, previously most youngsters just found jobs nearby, whereas now they tend to pursue a prospective career in metropolises owing to the convenience of transport as well as the centralized resources in big cities. Because of the long distance, it is not for older people to enjoy the company of their adult children. Another reason is that electrical devices have changed, like transport, shopping, communicating, and so forth. Consequently, elderly people are scared of going out and thus cannot meet their old friends frequently. As for health, previously living in houses meant the easiness of getting close to nature and engaging in exercise. However, the majority of people have moved to high-rise buildings and suffered from the lack of space to exercise, so it is not only an issue for elders but also for all generations.\n\nIn order to tackle these problems community should assume the responsibility. Firstly, the community service center can organize courses to help elderly people learn how to use smartphones and relevant functions. In this way, they are able to use video chat to connect with their adult children and friends, seek entertainment online, and conveniently travel to other places, which largely eliminate the sense of loneliness. Secondly, the community staff can also hold sociable events in order to gather elderly people together, providing opportunities to build new relationship and enjoy shared experiences. Thirdly, they can also construct fitness facilities suitable for elders in the community park, which must be a popular space to exercise, breathe fresh air, enjoy the greeneries, and chat with neighbors.\n\nIn conclusion, elderly people find it challenging for them to follow latest trend and adapt to the fast-changing world, primarily due to the modern lifestyle and electronics applications. The lonely feeling and health problems can be released by joint effort between community and themselves.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "The best way to reduce youth crime is to educate parents about good parenting skills. \nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "Essay": "Nowadays, the rate of youth crime has increased a lot. While training adults to be good parents is reasonable for reducing teenagers criminals, I think the best means to change this situation is to establish more restricted legislation.\n\nIt's true that parents play an important role in deterioration of youth crime. As we know, parents are always the first teacher of their children, because youngsters haven't formed a complete outlook of the world. Most youngsters distinguish whether something is right or wrong in terms of their parents' behaviours. Furthermore, a large amount of research has found that if parents once disobeyed the law or used violent ways to educate their children, their offspring would tend to involve in crime more than others. Therefore, parents should be instructed to use appropriate parenting skills in order to guide their offspring into a correct life path. For example, parents should be told to abandon violence while educating children.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, carrying out tougher law is the most effective method of reducing youth crime. At present, our regulation about punishing the teenagers criminals is not restricted enough. Thus, a great many youngsters do crime easily as they don't need to pay any cost for this. There are some young criminals who don't afraid of the punishment at all and continue to commit crimes for many times. It's no doubt that legislation is the most solid shield of offence, so the rate of youth crime will decrease only when the law become much tougher. What's more, educating every single parent to be good at parenting is much more expensive and time-consuming compared to establishing rules. \n\nIn conclusion, though teaching parents to educate offspring more correctly can be a proper way for reduce youth crime, the most efficient way is to modify the law more toughly.",

This essay aims to shed light on some aspects of interpersonal relationships that have been influenced by this trend. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the benefits of this shift prevail over the drawbacks.\n\nTechnology has profoundly revolutionized the way people communicate in various ways.

For instance, people nowadays can connect with their friends or family members in different places or countries through various social media platforms, such as Facebook or WhatsApp. Furthermore, the internet offers more opportunities for people to make friends and socialize. It has become a common phenomenon for people, especially young people, to liaise with those who have different cultural backgrounds.\nIn my perspective, this development can be both conducive and harmful. On the one hand, Individuals not only have more ways to acquire knowledge and information, but also have access to more means to build and maintain relationships. To be specific, there are a vast number of websites and platforms providing information of all kinds, which could not only expand their social circles but also provide opportunities in all aspects of life.

    "Essay": "It is an irrefutable reality that part of children spend too much time on their smartphones. The fundamental grounds that give rise to the phenomenon may be summarized as follows.\nFirst of all, with the boom of the Internet industry, it’s no longer a problem for individuals to get a electronic device, which leads to the fact that many kids have their own smartphones at a young age. Then, with social competition becoming keener, the situation of the job market is increasingly grim. Thus, taking more leisure time to company with their children becomes so elusive that the kids can only have fun themselves at home. Last but not least, children’s growing surroundings act as a catalyst. If their counterparts and parents are all addicted to playing this, they will take part in this subconsciously in order to align with others.\nAs for the effect, after a thorough and reasoned examination, I assert that the weaknesses derive from being addicted in smartphones substantially outbalance the potential merits. To begin with, children’s ability of imitation peak at the teenage and youngster period, but there are too many negative information on the Internet and they are too young to clarify. Therefore, they may learn something passive which is relatively perilous. Next, indulging in electronic device stifle their potential for growth and study. This principle holed true in various aspects of life. For instance, accustomed to short videos is likely to make children impetuous, so it is difficult for them to immerse themselves in reading a book.\nIn conclusion, plenty of reasons contribute to the wide use of smartphones, among which the development of technology is the most significant and the number of the downsides of this phenomenon is more than the merits.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "Essay": "Individuals hold different views about the primary environmental issue in this era. Some of them believe that extinction of special species of plants and animals is a major problem, while others argue that there are more critical issues. In my opinion, I agree with the second viewpoint.\n\nSome people assert that loss of plants and animals is a formidable challenge since it is detrimental to creature diversity and the ecosystem. On the one hand, if a particular species disappears from the earth, biologists will have no sample to conduct their research. In addition, the public can only see that species in a documentary rather than in a zoo or garden, which diminishes children’s curiosity about the nature. On the other hand, every creature is an essential part in the food chain. When one species dies out, its preys will proliferate uncontrollably, while its hunters will suffer from food shortage and even starve to death, causing irreversible damages to the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, others suggest that there are more serious environmental challenges, which affect human beings directly. One of the biggest concerns is global warming. Due to massive emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect increases temperature all over the world, triggering catastrophic disasters. For one thing, the melting of glaciers accelerates because of the increasing heat, which will bring rising sea level and engulf coastal cities, forcing citizens there to move to inland. In another note, high temperature and drought are easy to ignite wildfire. For example, the 2019-2020 forest fire in Australia was burning for several months, costing firemen and residents their lives as well as thousands of houses, leaving people homeless and in the pain of losing families. \n\nFrom my perspective, environmental problems that have direct impact on human welfare, such as climate changes, are more vital in modern society.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some scientists believe that studying the behaviour of 3-year-old children can predict which children could grow up to be criminals. In your opinion, to what extent is crime a product of human nature or is it possible to stop children from growing up to be criminals?",
    "Essay": "Some scientists consider that studying the behaviour of children who are 3 years old can give projections inwhich kids could grow up to be criminals. In my opinion, I totally disagree with the view that crime is a product of no more than human nature. I think education can stop children form growing up to be criminals.\n\nAdmittedly, two reasons can explain why some scientists think that studying the behaviour of children who are 3 years old can predict which children couldgrow up to be criminals. Firstly, This is may be because the 3 years old have already form behaviour habits. This period is important in their whole life style. If they have established the behaviour, they will follow it in their future. Secondly, scientists may find some examples in their research to prove the opinion. For example, some 3 years old children were predicted to be criminals in the future. The predict came true in the studying of the scientists.\n\nI think it is possible to stop kids from growing up to be criminals. We can use several ways to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can give some education to their children when they are 3 years. This will help them to set up true cognize. In addition, schools can have some lessons to teach children crime is not good for the society and themselves. This will help some children avoid the crime thinking.\n\nI disagree the opinion that studying the behaviour of children who are 3 years old can predict which children could grow up to be criminals.

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some scientists believe that studying the behaviour of 3-year-old children can predict which children could grow up to be criminals. In your opinion, to what extent is crime a product of human nature or is it possible to stop children from growing up to be criminals?",
    "Essay": "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about whether crime can be predicted by observing the behavior of 3-year-old children. Whether crime is a product of human nature can be a controversial issue. In my opinion, I think that it is possible to prevent children from growing up to be criminals. \n\nFirstly, parents are the first teachers to children and they can educate their children well. When children are born, they do not know anything about life and society, which are innocent and pure. Parents play an important role in teaching their children and guiding them in a right way. Also, parents should take responsibility for distinguishing their children what is right and false. As a result, children can be educated and also behaved well, which can reduce the crime rate in the future.\n\nMoreover, schools also play a crucial role in teaching children. After children are 4 years old, they need to go to kindergarten and primary school. Teachers will teach children some academic knowledge and build up their world views. Compared with parents, teachers and staff in school are more professional that know how to educate and motivate children. Even if they find some children may be aggressive, schools will provide professional solutions to help family to address the problems. So, it is possible to prevent children to become criminals in the future.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that all children will be a well-behaved person in the future. There are some external factors will affect children’s behaviors. For example, children will see some violet video showing on TV and social media, which lead children to a wrong way and become aggressive. However, that can be solved out by parents and schools. If these two parties can cooperate each other and create a good environment for children to live, which can reduce the crime rate. \n\nIn conclusion, I do not think crime is a product of human nature and it is possible to stop children becoming criminals in the future if parents and schools can educated well.",

Some experts think that we can predict whether the children would crime from their early behaviors. But in my opinion, the reasons why a human become a criminal are based on many other factors, and it’s possible to make children becoming good citizens during educations. \n\nFirst, it is obvious that the environment around one’s life is considerably affect the crime rate. This is because if children grow up in a complex circumstance which is full of criminal events, they would like to imitate crime and have a try of themselves. Therefore, the living environments of children is important influence to make them be criminals. \n\nMoreover, the degree of economic development also effects whether children will become criminals or not. Economic underdevelopment may lead social unrest, for example, it usually makes people hard to get food and money, also may flood with war. So, children will have no chance to go to school for study, even cannot get food and stay hungry everyday. \n\nBesides, there are some methods to stop children from growing up to be criminals.

As far as I am concerned, although human nature could be a significant factor in producing criminals, there are still many methods we can take to prevent children from being a threat to society.\n    Like many studies convinced children can be evil even when they are too young to understand the consequences of what they have done. But what I want to say is children wouldn’t end up being a criminal without gone through a specific process or shown symptoms as a trigger. Some documentaries I have seen reported that most criminals, for example those killers, would start their murder trials when they were young by crushing little bugs and then killing small animals like rats, cats or even dogs. If parents can’t figure out what happened in time, the victim would become human. Thus, good care and enough attention should be provided to every child when they are at home, especially those who already had some attack actions toward others.\n    When children grow up to the age of attending school, the responsibility of acting as a role model for correct behaviors is not only on parents but also on teachers. Education in schools, at most cases, is the primary source of teaching people how to be a good person and do what is right. Not similar to parents, teachers stand on a more objective point of estimating children from their behaviors. That’s why teachers always have strict standards for students. Through two-sides guidance and effective communication between parents and teachers, children’s bad thoughts will be known and their behavioral problems will be solved. \nIn conclusion, it is possible to make a pullback of children’s crime tendency if we all offering them for enough chances to change.",

    "Essay": "Some museums charge fees if the public wants to visit them and people have different comments on it. I completely think that museums should not charge the public, whose benefits outweigh the disadvantages so far.\n\nFirstly, the drawbacks are very limited and can be reasonably resolved mostly. If a museum charge for admission, the possible benefit is that this museum can generate more revenue. However, the price cannot be too high, otherwise the number of visitors will decrease. Therefore, the benefits that can be increased by doing so are very limited. Subsidies from relevant governments and departments can compensate for this. So there is no need for museums to take risks in charging.\n\nThen, advantages are far outweigh the disadvantages from many aspects. On the one hand, for public, not only can people save a certain amount of money, but they can receive effective education as well which greatly helps to improve their scientific and cultural literacy. Especially for children, visiting local museums can enhance their understanding of their hometown, while visiting museums when traveling to other places can deepen their understanding of the customs and traditions of a new place, which has an immeasurable impact on children's growth. \n\nOn the other hand, for the government, it is a part of the education industry and cultural investment. It can increase the happiness of local people and also help outsiders better identify with local culture, the latter can bring the arrival of talents, the development of the tourism industry, and so on, which has a profound impact on the development of the economy and even the entire industry of urban area.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I believe that there is no need for museums to charge, the benefits of free museums are more satisfying.",

    "Essay": "Nowadays, museums have increasing popularity among citizens, but whether museums should ask traveler to pay for the tickets become a question. In my opinion, the advantages of charging people for admission to museums is more than the disadvantages.\nFirst of all, museums can use the money earning from tourists to maintain exhibits and environments of museums. Museums pay lots of money on protecting the exhibits, because most of them are invaluable and historically meaningful, and it necessary to protect them carefully. So, if museums charge for admission, they can use the earn to better protect their collections.\n\nBesides, charging for tickets can avoid some people who are not willing to visit the museum and just stroll around. For example ,in the summer, there are usually very hot in the outside and someone want to go to the museum to enjoy the cool air. Most of them are not really interested in the collections of museum and maybe sometimes make some noise to affect those who are visiting the museum seriously.\n\nNevertheless, paid tickets still have disadvantages that restrict poor people from visiting museums for education. Because of the educational meaning of museums, it is not fair for poor individuals that they also have the right to visit museums. The charging of tickets makes them hardly have chance to go to museums and learn more about the history of China.

    "Essay_Prompt": "Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "Essay": "An increasing number of museums are choosing to charge for admission. Although these museums can own better facilities and employ more staff, their social assessment will decrease and this trend will have a negative effect on cultural communication. Therefore, I believe that this choice does more harm than good.\nOne obvious disadvantage to charging for admission is that some people will have a poor impression of these banned museums, as a few individuals in pottery are forbidden to enter. Seeing the wealthy people strut around the museums, the average people are rejected outside with few coins in the pockets. As a result, they feel discriminated and may leave negative messages about the museums on internet. \nIn addition, another problem of charging for admission is that the average aesthetic taste of society will decline. People hesitate before paying entrance fee, and then are attracted by other free public facilities. As fewer people visit museums, the frequency of people appreciate artwork or other exhibits drop. For example, it is reported that the several impressionists were shocked by the creativity when they saw the abstract paintings the first time in life. As the wonderful ideas spark continuously, these impressionists created a few world masterpieces soon. This situation will gradually disappear under the law of charging for admission, considering not every artist is affordable to visit enough museums.\nOn the other hand, many museums might have a growing fund to employ workers and maintain facilities. It is not rare that some free museums are shut off, as a consequence of lacking of money to operate. By contrast, vistors might be more interested in the exhibition, if they are guided by profssional interpreters, or wear headsets to listen to detailed commentary. With various convenient facilities, more tourist might come to the museums. \nIn conclusion, although some museums charging for admission might have more money to improve the quality of service, this ban may bring the museums a poor social assessment and reduce the average aesthetic taste of society, which are far more important factors to take into consideration. Thus, I strongly believe that the museums charging for admission bring more cons than pros.",

    "Essay": "Whether museums charge for entrance fee or not is a frequently discussed and controversial topic. In my opinion, museum is supportive to collect fares from tourists. \n\nIf museum fees are free, more people may have a fair opportunity same with other to see artworks whatever they are conventional or modern. It is a good way to nurture people’s aesthetic abilities and values. Most of the time, children’s aesthetic educations start from observing a painting, a sculpture or a pottery to understand why they look like in appearance or what’s the story behind when artists created them. And it is no doubt that museums are always a best place for parents to bring their children and learn artworks. Therefore, charging by museums has its drawbacks.\n\nHowever, from other perspective, charging by museums do benefit to museums themselves. Firstly, it can constrain carrying capacity effectively to avoid people crowded in gallery halls or exhibitions of museums . The quantity control of carrying capacity is an essential for people safety and artwork safeguard. Secondly, fee collection is also a vital source for museum to get their funding. Those money is usually used to maintain and repair artwork by specialists. Normally specialists, especially professors of art are well known costly. If museums don’t have their own funding to do maintenance and fixing, they must seek for government’s help. Otherwise, they can sustain the business of museums. Then it potentially imposes the threat of taxation to people. In addition, they also utilize these funding to hire employees for daily management or doing cleaning works, so that museums can run as usual. \n\nConsidering fee charging is crucial and good for museums to strive for their prospective future, I strongly believe that the advantages of a reasonable fee collected by museums outweigh than its disadvantages.",

    "Essay": "The first downside is that museum fees may dissuade some visitors from learning about and accepting local history and culture. \n\nLooking at the benefits, there are three aspects. First, museum fees are conducive to alleviating the financial pressure on the government. In the case of free, museum staff salaries and venue maintenance costs are highly dependent on government spending, and fees can subsidize some of the expenses, or break even, and may even be profitable. The money saved by the government can be invested in other areas that are needed, such as education, health care and infrastructure. \n\nSecond, after the museum has a certain amount of funds through fees, it can not only be used to improve venue facilities and maintain exhibits, but also invest in more new technologies, such as combining VR technology with exhibits to enrich the browsing experience of the audience and improve its own attractiveness. \n\nThird, the museum can control the number of visitors through ticket charging, such as a limit of 10,000 tickets a day, divided into morning and afternoon hours, the flow limit can avoid the problems that may occur when there are too many tourists for free, such as too many people leading to a poor visiting experience, visitors can only see the crowded heads, or overcrowding leads to injury to people, or the collection is damaged.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?",
    "Essay": "It is a well-known fact that an immense amount of food is wasted in contemporary days, since today’s society has become richer many citizens have started wasting. Therefore, this essay shall elaborate on the reasons for this phenomenon, along with discussing possible solutions for overcoming this issue.\n\nWhether it’s food purchased in restaurants or supermarkets, one of the main causes of waste is the overconsumption patterns in today’s society. People feel empowered because of their economic status, so they lose the essence of food purchases and take overconsumption for granted. As economies become more powerful, all citizens have access to food that satisfies their pickiest preferences, but the use of anything inevitably leads to waste, as evidenced by the fact that many homes have refrigerators filled with water.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, educating young people may be the best way to fight waste. It’s clear that children can actually have a significant impact on their parents’ shopping patterns, and in this case, even ordering at dining establishments. If a concerted effort is made to teach the old adage “don’t want, don’t waste,” this philosophy will trickle down to parents through osmosis, leading to parents taking more responsibility for the food waste they cause. Finally, a more effective or more aggressive, way to stop food waste would be to simply tax households and restaurant customers on the amount of food waste produced.\n\nIn summary, with high levels of disposable income, an attitude of over-consumption appears to be the main cause of food waste, whether purchased from grocery stores or in restaurants, and the most effective long-term solution to this problem is education from an early age young people.",

    "Essay": "Recently, the topic of undergraduates moving out of home is better than living with their parents has aroused people's thinking. I generally agree with this view.\n\nFirst of all, being away from home could cultivate students’ independent spirit. Moving out of home means students need to face life alone, including studying, eating, and going shopping have to rely on their own to complete. It is a big challenge for college students who are only 18 years old, and it is an important way to quickly develop an independent spirit. On the contrary, many parents are willing to help their children complete those things that should be done by their own children, such as buying stationery, finding learning materials, and so on. These behaviors are not beneficial to college students forming independent spirits. \n\nWhat’s more, being away from home could make students more space to do something their like. Not living at home means their parents could not regulate them, who would have more free time to give play to their strengths. In the early time, my neighbor's sister had a gift for drawing, and she loved drawing, too. However, her parents argued that drawing pictures waste much learning time, so she had to give up drawing. Later, she goes to the university and then lives away from home. She picks up the drawing pencil again. With the gift and endeavor, she becomes a young drawer.\n\nAlthough I think leaving home has many advantages for college students, it is undeniable that there are also some disadvantages. For instance, college students may lack communication with their parents, and they may get sick easily if they can't take good care of themselves. But all in all, I think the advantages of college students living away from home outweigh the disadvantages.",

    "Essay": "University plays a vital role in one's growth as well as life. It is the holy hall where students are trained to become mature, more intelligent, and independent as well. In that circumstance, I wholeheartedly hold the view that it is much better for students to live away from home when they are at university than living with parents. The details are as follows \n\nInitially, living away from home means that students are required to take care of themselves, for no one will prepare supper for them or simply wake them up in the morning anymore. Basic living skills that were learnt during students' college days can lay a solid foundation for their future lives. Not only that, it is also quite significant for students to maintain the balance between learning and leisure time, and living away from home means students need to plan their schedules reasonably. Only through this way can their youth bloom with health and beauty. \n\nAdditionally, if students share their on-suite or dormitory with roommates, it will be unavoidable but also meaningful for them to learn to live harmoniously with others. This can shape their personalities as well as daily behaviors that may contribute to a qualified citizen. What's more, living away from family can frequently bring out the best in us. For instance, when students face mental obstacles, they are forced to find their own ways to get rid of bad mood as well as to find the inner peace by themselves. Last but not least, there can be a huge gap between a university student's schedule and their parents', so living away from home can benefit both sides, not to mention that many parents can eventually enjoy their time after being interrupted by their children for decades. \n\nFrom what has been discussed above, we may draw the conclusion that there are plenty of advantages for college students to live away from home. We call on university students to promote their living and social skills while living away from home while keeping in mind that you should care for your parents regularly.",

    "Essay_Prompt": "As the society is advancing by leaps and bounds, many college students choose to live away from home and live in university accommodation. In my point of view, living away from one’s family is more beneficial for students’ development.\n\nThere is no denying that living with parents brings about comfort and convenience for university students because they can enjoy the care and attention from their parents and rely on them whatever they are in difficulty. Their parents can make well-balanced and nutritious diet for them and enhance students’ fitness. By contrast, in most universities, students complain about the poor quality of food in dining hall.\n\nDespite the above merits, much heavier weight should be attached to the strengths triggered by living in the campus for youth growth. One benefit of living separately from home is that people can develop independence. Without the constant support of their parents, they have to do everything themselves such as washing clothes, buying shoes, and so on. Undoubtedly, independence is an important factor required for students.\n\nIn addition, leaving home means that people can enjoy greater freedom in social life. They can make friends with their roommates, and develop the communication skills. Their roommates may come from different regions or countries, which leads to different customs and habits. And the kindly communication between their roommates from different background improve students’ social communication skills. \n\nIn conclusion, I consider that the idea of living independently when student grow up and go to university should be support.",
    "Essay": "Although living anywhere is not as comfortable as living at home, in youth, it is also a good choice to try campus life without parents. The growth after living independently in school is really something that can only be understood by experiencing it firsthand. While some students think that living on campus may require financial considerations, the new experience you get is immeasurable in money. \n\nDormitory life is really fun, even if your room may not be too big. Living on campus gives you the opportunity to meet more people, such as students of different grades who live in the same dormitory as you, so that you are not alone. In the process of getting along with new partners, I can also subtly learn a lot of the essence of doing things. Another point worth noting is that if you choose to stay, it will be very close to the school building, and the commute time saved every morning can be used to get more sleep to ensure that you have enough sleep, or use this time to go to the classroom early to memorize words. \n\nBut dormitory life will also have drawbacks, while you need to deal with more people, it is inevitable that you will encounter some conflicts, contradictions, or difficult classmates, which may bring you unnecessary trouble. On the other hand, dormitories are shared spaces, which may be four or six people, and it is difficult to have a private space. \n\nAll in all, if you can afford it, if you can have such an experience, it will be colorful, but there may be some troubles that you have to learn to solve on your own.",

    "Essay": "Some people hold the view that university students are supposed to live away from home, while others believe that it’s better for them to live with parents. I totally agree with the idea that living without parents is more beneficial for university students. \n\nFirst and foremost, living away from family improves students’ living skills. For most Chinese children, parents look after them for all aspects of life before they go to the college. Thereby, lack of living experience is a quiet common phenomenon for Chinese children. Living away from their parents provides them an opportunity to develop their independence. Additionally, living without family offers students more private space in life where they can make daily decisions on their own and avoid some annoying control from parents. It can be an effective solution for families that are suffering from endless quarrels and fights. \n\nOn the flip side, the argument that university students should live with parents is predicated on the belief that without parents’ companion, young teenagers may feel isolation and depression. Usually, parents are the most familiar people to students as they spend most of their teenager’s time with parents. Meanwhile, going to the university means entering a new environment. However, some students may miss out the emotion support without parents living with.\n \nTo sum up, though it’s reasonable for students at university to live with parents, I still hold the stance that university students are supposed to live away from their parents because it’s helpful for them.",

    "Essay": "The role of money in bringing happiness is a topic that continues to be debated. Totally, there are two main aspects money regards to happiness. From my perspective, money is the key to life. \n\nIntuitively, money can bring happiness to people. Source to attain happiness is various, and people clarify them into two categories predominantly, that is material aspect and spiritual aspect, whichever is based on money. Here are reasonings. \n\nIt is easy to be understood that, within the scope allowed by law, in material aspect, everything supporting us to attain entertainment can be bought if we have enough money. With enough money, not only travelling around the world but also buying everything we prefer, are available. No matter what kind of life you would like to taste, you will have an absolutely stable support. The tweeting of birds in a serene evening accompanied by the golden sunlight reflected on the leaves, the carefree coffee time sitting in a sofa near a french window, all the joys are just twinkling glass balls grasped arbitrarily in the jar placed under your palm. Maybe, some people will think that lover’s intimacy, family companion and unforgettable precious time, are beyond the realm that money can buy. But, all of these need money, even massive amounts. When we will prepare a surprise birthday party for lover, we need money to buy those items needed. When we decide to have a picnic with our families instead of working overtime, we need to refuse our bosses only if we do not care that extra overtime pay. All of these require us to get enough money. \n\nFrom another aspect, money can prevent unhappiness and unlucky. I would like to use two examples to demonstrate that may be a little burdensome, but unquestioned. Firstly, as the most basic thing of our lives, not only keeping healthy but also getting effective cure when falling ill, needs a large number of money. The systematical nutritionally balanced diet plan, the conscientious doctor, and even a good attitude, in order to gain these, adequate money is inevitable. Secondly, money will be helpful to avoid a lot of risks. It is easy to imagine that in the case of all kinds of investments, which I mean that, both those commercial and market investments and the metaphysical things like investing for our future lives, for a brilliant career. Attaining enough and efficacious information is vital, and needless to say that the determining factors for this, is money.",

Happiness is a state of mind and is also tied to the wellbeing of the people we love. \n\nBecause of money, people can live their lives by having anything they want.

If they become ill, they can also receive the best treatment.\n\nA rich person who has money can buy all the things and may seem to be happy, but it does not imply that a poor person is not happy. A person who is always busy earning money and business hardly has time to spend with his family. A poor person may have more relax time to stay with their family.\n\nIn addition, rich people may be lonelier. They often spend lots of time in hard working and making more money. They may have no chance to stay with their parents and friends. It is very important for everyone to interact with their close friends. It gives them internal happiness and satisfaction that someone who cares for them. \n\nIn conclusion, while money is essential for meeting daily needs, it is not required for achieving happiness.

It is hard for person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be met only through money, while more money can make us live in a better house and go to better restaurants to have a great meal. Therefore, it can make people have a pleasure life. So, many people regard money as a source of happiness.\n\nAlthough money is a important source of getting a enjoyment life, some people define happiness as something deeper and pursing the metal happiness. In order to live a good life, we not only just improve the quality of life by making more money, but also could do something meaningful such as doing voluntary work or helping the elderly. Though these activities, some people could get a sense of achievement. In addition, spending time with family and friends would also make us feel relaxed and enjoyment. Because some people may suppose that sharing experiences with their family or friends could make them release pressure from study or work, and it is even the greatest joy.\n \nIn conclusion, the way of achieving happiness is different to every person. Money is one of important sources, but other metal factors may more vital.\n\n",

Below certain level of balance, basic demands, such as foods, accommodations, and personal safety, can hardly be met. Furthermore, people may stuggle with serious diseases that should have been treated in hospitals, generating much medical fees. However, most of people without savings may suffer from starvation, needless to say extra fees for such security. As a result, they may get infected and sustain the pain.\n\nAdditionally, more money available, people may feel content with convenient products and gain values through social activities, instead of worrying about survival. For example, people with sufficient money can purchase private cars, which can make trips comfortable, such as avoid getting wet in rainy days. Moreover, people may get acknowlegement and respect by communicating with friends when attending activities.\n\nAnother benefit come from wealth that cannot be ignored is the spiritual richness. People with sufficient money can invest themselves, particularly in education, and change attitudes towards the misfortune in their life. To examplify, people are more likely to broden the scope of their minds through reading or traveling, when people can experience various lifestyles, and exchange thoughts with others. Consequently, people can confront with problems in daily life and feel satisfied.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that money can provide humans happiness in physical and mental ways.\n\n",

    "Essay": "While some people hold the view that money is significant for achieving happiness, others tend to believe that realizing happiness relies on various factors. From my point of view, though money can lead to temporary happiness, true happiness is decided by other more vital things.\nFor one hand, money guarantees people’s essential living demands and gives a chance for people to enjoy physical entertainment. Nowadays, money is the widest-use tool for transactions, which means that people can buy almost everything and every service via money. In other words, the majority of human beings’ material desires can be satisfied through money. Thereby, the sense of fulfilling short-term desires can give people a misunderstanding that they have achieved real happiness. \nNevertheless, true happiness has nothing to do with the material demands but the harmonious relationship with the world, including the nature, society and people themselves. To begin with, over-exploiting resources for profit will lead to environmental disasters and people have to pay back these money. Secondly, it’s quiet common for rich people to feel unhappy for the fact that they fail to maintain the balance between families and career. As a result, they may lose the companion of family and a sense of isolation will raise, which causes the depression and sadness. Last but not the least, some people devote their whole lives chasing money, but it turns out that wealth cannot give them sense of fulfillment and isn’t the ultimate goal for their lives. \nTo sum up, money is beneficial for short happiness but people have to draw more attention on mental harmony if they want to have real happiness.\n\n",

    "Essay": " In recent years, food waste has become a more prominent social problem than ever before, not only causing economic losses on society, but also unfairly treating those who cannot resist hunger.\n\nThe causes of food waste can be divided into three main aspects First, some food suppliers will not be economical in order to make more money, such as using large amounts of packaging to cover up low-quality food. In addition, food is also easily damaged during transportation and sale, which can bring a lot of losses when they are thrown away due to quality problems. Finally, most consumers are not frugal, they buy too much food but end up throwing most of it away.\n\nIf the problem of food waste has to be solved, several key steps need to be taken. Food suppliers should be reformed from government policies to promote frugality and deal with large quantities of packaging and poor quality products. The government should provide more free helping services to help those who are too poor to buy food. Moreover, government should also carry out anti-food waste publicity for the society to educate people about the importance of saving food.\nIn general, food waste not only brings much harmfulness to the society, but also violates the principle of fairness and justice. Therefore, a concerted effort should be made through legislation, advocacy and assistance to enable more people who in poverty and failing to make their ends meet to have opportunities access to adequate food and shelter.

    "Essay": "It is true that people in many nations have been wasting large amount of foods. I think there are a variety of reasons why individuals always waste food like this. But families, schools, and governments can take steps to mitigate these problems.\n\nIn my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the way people waste food nowadays. Firstly, some people with higher social status and economic status are unaware of the preciousness of food. They do not know the thrown food is essential for many people in a country or region who are unable to access adequate food supplies. Secondly, Lacking of proper guidance and knowledge at a young age, people do not have the habit of saving food from an early age. Finally, people are influenced by the social climate of wastefulness.\n\nPeople behaviour can certainly be improved. I believe that the change must start with parents who need to be persuaded that it is important to be a role model for their children and teach their children not to waste food. Also, schools should add course of food and famine to compulsory curriculums, thus instilling valuing food into young mind, and in improving the awareness of conserving food. At the same time, the governments should organize public lectures on food conservation and launch some public service announcements to increase public awareness of the problem of food waste and launching an appeal to raise the concern for starved people.\n\nIn conclusion, various ways and means can be adopted to tackle the issues that are certain to lead to food waste.\n",

In order to reduce it, several methods are supposed to be taken.\nFirst and foremost, with the rapid improvement of human’s living standard, food has become a symbol of high quality lifestyle, though it’s still a necessity for everyone. As a result, many people will order a large amounts of food for curiousness of their flavor but throw them away after taste. For them, having tasted the food is much more important than eat up the food. This argument can be proved by the example of extraordinary popularity of milk tea in China, which are thrown away after drinking a little and posing the photo on the social platform. Additionally, lack of teaching frugalness in modern education do contribute to this phenomenon, as young people nowadays seldom realize the seriousness of wasting food.\nThereby, some suggestions are given as follows to curb the situation. First of all, education authority are supposed to add saving food as part of compulsory moral courses, from primary education to senior education. This steps can instill a moral boundary in young people’s mind that saving food is a virtue. Secondly, government should create public service advertisements and organize public lectures about seriousness of throwing food, by which can effectively raise the awareness of saving of public.\nTo sum up, various factors leading to wasting food, including fast changing in the society and lack of related education, and we urgently need some measures to solve the problem of it.\n\n",

    "Essay": "The argument of whether space exploration is a waste of resources or an essential research for human beings elicits various opinions. From my point of view, exploring the universe is beneficial for human’s future. \nThe idea in favor of space exploration wasting resources is rests on the belief that despite of devoting a large amount of time and resources, it seldom makes financial payback. Usually, it takes approximately 3 to 5 years to prepare one space travel with consuming a great quantity of money and human resources. Nevertheless, without the overwhelming news coverage, it seems like no tangible contribution has been achieved, for the fact that there’s no actual improvement in people’s living standards. For a short termview, space exploration is more like a unprofitable investment in scientific field, or even a way to showcase nation’s research development. \nOn the flip side, it’s reasonable for others to hold the stance that space exploration is basic for human’s future First and foremost, it is a great possibility that abundant resources are hided in universe. Universe resembles a black box filled with mysteries, danger and surprise. Since the resources on the earth is limit, exploring new resources is fundamental for humankind’s long-term existence. Additionally, scientists are aimed to find an appropriate second planet for human beings due to the reliable deduction of sun exploding in the future. Only in space research can people find an approach to save ourselves.\nTo sum up, though space exploration seems to be a waste in the short term, it brings advantages for humankind in a long term. \n",

    "Essay": "The growing trend towards overweight and poor health condition among children has raised worldwide concerns. Some people hold the stance that government is responsible for solving the problem. However, I partly agree with this idea.\n\nUndoubtedly, governments play a significant role in preventing the tendency towards children’s increasing weight and worse physical health. For instance, governments can impose higher tax on food containing high sugar and fat, so that the price on these high energy food will raise. Consequently, parents might buy less unhealthy snake for their children. Additionally, government can contribute by launching public campaign and issuing public advertisement to raise awareness about the importance of keep children in fit.\n\nNevertheless, it’s far more than enough if only government take the responsibility. First and foremost, family education is the basis for curbing this tendency. Parents are supposed to emphasize the seriousness of overweight and unhealthy body to their children, which is greatly helpful for children to form health diet habit. What’s more, it’s also schools’ duty to stop the trend. Besides some mandatory academic courses, schools are supposed to encourage they students to exercise more during studying by holding sports meeting and morning running activities. Therefore, with sufficient exercises, children tend to be more health.\n\nTo sum up, governments shoulder part of the responsibility of decreasing the amount of overweight and unhealthy children, family and schools are also essential roles to solve the problem.\n",

Some people concern about watching TV is bad for children, while others believe that TV programs are beneficial for children’s growing up. In my opinion, I think that watching TV can give kids some useful knowledge and is good for their growing up. \n\nOn the one hand, some people argue that watching television everyday is detrimental to children’s growth. Firstly, it is bad for children’s physical development. They often spend hours sitting in front of the screens, causing damaging to their eyesight and physical postures. Secondly, watching TV for long time lead to degradation of academic performance. Children may stay up late for the interesting films. So, they are hard to focus in classes and not able to do well in assignments and exams. \n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that watching TV is good for developing children. To start with, some educational television programs are recommended to watch. For example, some program about science, nature and global news are meaningful for enhancing children’s wide knowledge and information. These shows give children more chance to get know more about nature and choose their own interest. There is also many information that student can not learn in the school.

I think that this trend has many benefits in the modern society.\n\nFirstly, the alternative medicines and treatments used extensively have an advantageous effect on the economic development. Building hospitals need much funding support from governments and consuming construction materials. Meantime, the hole of doctors will expand leading to countries to invest budget in training new doctors and nurses. Therefore, it may impose a burden on governments to develop other industries, such as the financial industry, the textile industry, and the educational organization. This tendency may cause a decline in some industrial developments and a drop in the economy.\n\nSecondly, patients may improve their living level when they can cure by alternative medicines or treatments. Looking doctors are usually those people who patients and family members or friends of patients need to organise a part of the time to go to the hospital and take public transportation or private cars. This means that patients will waste time in the round route cause they can not to do other things, like meeting colleagues or completing their tasks.

    "Essay": "Whether children should be reared in professional institutions or at home has generated wide-ranging controversy. Some people hold the view that family is the best place for kids to grow up, while others insist that childcare organizations can offer well-rounded care. From my perspective, I agree with the latter statement.\n\nGranted, it is true that family members are able to provide their children with more emotional value and freedom. Family members, such as parents and grandparents, are who toddlers trust the most and always want to stay with. In most cases, they can provide abundant love and patience, so young children will feel a sense of safety and belonging when accompanied by family. Besides, children’s personalized needs are more likely to be satisfied, such as their dietary or other interest preferences. This is not hard to comprehend, as family members only focus on their own children. Thus, more attention can be allocated to each child individually. Hence, it is evident that young children raised at home can experience greater happiness and flexibility.\n\nHowever, I agree with the view that professional organizations can benefit children more in terms of both cognitive and social development. As for cognition, professionals can make sure children are taught necessary knowledge and skills scientifically in accordance with their age, which cannot be guaranteed at home. Since these practitioners are more professional and experienced in raising and educating children, where most ordinary people only have limited experience. When it comes to social development, there is no doubt that interpersonal skills can be better honed in a public environment. In other words, when children venture beyond their homes, they must learn to navigate relationships with various individuals, such as their peers, teachers, nurses, and so on. In these relations, they will enhance their communication skills, cooperative skills, leadership ability, empathy ability, etc., which are all useful in their future life.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, although children may gain more happiness and freedom at home, they alone don’t necessarily lead to better long-term development. Accordingly, professional institutions become a better choice, as it fosters children’s well-rounded growth. At the same time, more quality time should be spent with family after school to make sure children can grow up with love and happiness.\n",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Many people contend that it is pointless to save endangered species because the extinction of animals is destined, like dinosaurs and dodos. However, I disagree with the statement because I believe some effective measures should be taken to slow this process as human activities have immensely accelerated it. \n\nOn the one hand, animal extinction has far exceeded its natural speed due to human activities, such as overhunting and excessive deforestation. For instance, the Bengal tiger, once abundant in the dense forests of India, is now endangered as a result of the destruction of its habitat, which has been replaced by farmland. The alarming decline of the Bengal tiger population highlights the direct link between human actions and the accelerated rate of species extinction. Human activities are definitely to blame for unnatural extinction of many animals.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out without taking any action, as the earth exists not only for the benefits of human. Furthermore, the extinction of animal species poses a threaten on the balance of ecosystem, which will ultimately affect human survival. Therefore, whether for the sake of ecological health or human survival, we should recognize the emergency of current situation and act to protect the diversity of ecosystem.

    "Essay": "It seems that some entertainment stars are considered to make more fortune than they should. Personally, I agree with this opinion, and there are some other works that deserve higher income.\n \nIn my opinion, people should not make plenty of money just because of their good-looking faces or well-known fame. It is true that some entertainers who can bring enjoyment are admired by many young people who are willing to spend much money on them. For example, one of the most popular stars in China is a young person called Cai Xukun, who only have a handsome face without any specialized talents, and he is able to make 1 million yuan in one day. The truth is that he does not deserve this number of money because in reality he never do anything beneficial to society with hardworking, such as technical innovations and scientific researches. To explain, a country cannot gain development only with singing and dancing; it need more people who can devote themselves to a better society.\n\nIn comparison, those scientists and scholars are supposed to gain much more salaries. It is obvious that these citizens have more benefits to the advancement of society. If every residents are desire to become an actor or singer, there will be no people to do more scientific researches and come up with effective theories which can be applied to industry to promote the productivity. Therefore, the increase of their incomes is necessary, so more people will concentrate on these positive works without worries of money. In this way, the society can create more innovative technologies and ideas, meaning that they could establish a more sustainable, wealthier, healthier life for every citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, measures should be taken to curb the fortune of less-productive celebrities, while it is desirable to enable scientists and professors to attain higher payments.\n\n",

    "Essay": "Whether in individuals' professional career or daily lives, taking adventures is increasingly common. Some people support that it is crucial for people and I believe that taking adventures would bring more advantageous influences.\n\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that adventures would cause some negative effects. Firstly, several kinds of adventures might be likely to cause accidents which may threaten individuals' safety and health. Take skydiving for example, this extreme sport has a possibility of losing life if some accident happens, like the parachute fails to open. Secondly, it would also rise mental pressure and stress. If a man fail to take risk, such as failing to start up his own business, he would feel upset and unsatisfied with himself, being more likely to lose confidence and refusing to make an effort again. In addition, taking adventures which means a large amount of uncertainty, posed a heavy and serious pressure on people since people might invest a lot, like time, funds and even whole life.\n\nOn the other hand, many benefits would be brought which would outweigh the adverse one in my opinion. Taking adventures would bring large rewards, whether material or spiritual. If some people set up their own companies and spare no effort to operating them, they might earn a great number of money. Besides, they would gain a sense of achievement and overjoy during the adventures. Additionally, during the whole process of taking risks, individuals gain a overall progress and receive more life experiences which cannot be owned by people who are not willing to take risk. For instance, the people who try skydiving would gain a new point of view to see the nature's beauty and overcome the fear and step out of comfort zone, which are all treasures among people's life.\n\nIn conclusion, although some dangers might be caused by adventures, more rewards can be gained overweight the disadvantages.\n",

    "Essay_Prompt": "It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives. \nDo you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?\n",
    "Essay": "Nowadays, it is acceptable by some people that taking risks in occupation and lives of person is very necessary, but some people believe taking risks is not beneficial for them. Personally, I deem taking risks can give people more advantages if they think about the situations clearly.\n\nFirst, taking risks can give people more chances, so it is possible for them to succeed in occupation. As the economy crisis, people are difficult to get a good job or achieve promotion in their career. This means that taking risks can help employee make some changes and have good performances to their bosses, which may make workers set apart from the groups because of good impression to leaders. If they do not have brave to take risks and just satisfy with ordinary work, they are difficult to prove their abilities and talent. \n\nSecond, taking risks is helpful for people to gain good character or abilities in personal lives. This is because taking risks will give people challenges and hinders, therefore people will improve their abilities during trying their best to overcome them, which also can make people more confident. For example, when some students choose to study abroad rather than studying at local, they need to face more risks and difficulties. However, this makes it possible for some students to cultivate their independent skills of lives and become strong for fails, meanwhile, they can get experiences after taking risks, which help them achieve success in their rest of life.\nHowever, taking risks may lead people to failing or getting anxiety, so it is necessary for them to consider risks clearly. If they can make specific plans to the risks and think of the results in advance, they will be more possible to get success. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe people should be brave to take risks in their work or lives, which can give them opportunities of promotion and help them improve their abilities.\n",

    "Essay_Prompt": "On vehicle-free day, private cars, trucks, and motorcycles are banned in the city centre while public transport, such as bicycles, buses, and taxis are permitted. \nDo the benefits of vehicle-free day outweigh the disadvantages?\n",
    "Essay": "The amount of emission produced by all kinds of vehicles have already become considerable. To lower the pollution being generated, it is a popular idea that there should be a vehicle-free day when all private vehicles except bikes are all abandoned. Decried as a naive and unrealistic illusion by some, it is also defended by others as a feasible method to limit emission. In my perspective, I believe this idea can only do more harm than good.  \n\nThe supporters of such policy argue that it can significantly reduce the volume of waste gas produced since people will have to rely on public transportation which generally create less pollution. They also hold the view that the setting of vehicle-free day can lower the demand for oil thus its price can decrease. In addition, it seems that traffic jam can also be avoided in this way as there might be fewer cars on the road. As a result, it is reasonable for such plan to gain a number of supporters considering so many benefits.  \n\nHowever, I shall state that these benefits are generally hard to achieve. Oil prices will not drop since the high demand from bus and taxi drivers will soon fill the gap caused by the lack of private car drivers. Traffic jams will still be triggered when thousands of taxis and buses are tucked on the road during the rushing hours. Besides, when people are forced to select from the limited ways of transportation, it is very likely for them to be overcharged. For instance, a worker has no choice but to accept the high fee offered by a taxi driver when he has to go home in the late night and there is not any public transportation available. Last but not least, the vehicle-free day will bring huge inconvenience to people's daily lives. Unable to use private vehicles to take patients to the hospital directly is just one of the hundreds of examples. \n\nIn conclusion, I consider the proposal of vehicle-free day as an unrealistic dream which is impossible to fulfill. Not only because it will bring about lots of drawbacks, but also since its advantages are dubious to be achievable. \n",

    "Essay": "The development of tourism is always considered as an important economic sector by all the governments since it could bring huge financial benefits to the economy. However, it has also triggered a controversial topic whether there are responsible tourists who care about the local environment and cultures. A large number of people declare that all the tourists are exploitative and harmful to the local residents’ daily lives. The following content will try to analyse the potential reasons of this belief and the possible solutions to alter it.  \n \nAdmittedly, certain groups of tourists have done lots of damage to the scenery spots they have been to. Piles of rubbish which can been seen everywhere is just one of the hundreds of examples. Moreover, most foreign travelers fail to be fully aware the local customs and religions before setting out. This can lead to a break of the local laws which might leave a bad impression to the residents. The power of press also contributes its own efforts. In today's society, when a visitor creates negative impacts, they can be spread to the public with considerable speed. The accumulation of similar events will form a stereotype that all the travelers are rude and unconcerned. Yet in reality these are just behaviors of some individuals.  \n \nFrom my perspective, a feasible way to change this kind of prejudice is to enhance the personal quality of tourists. It will be better to equip every group of travelers with a guide who can supervise their behaviors. In this way some damage towards the regional environment and customs might be prevented. In addition, everyone should realize that personal behaviors cannot represent the whole group of visitors. It is not reasonable to remain hostile and suspicious to all the tourists.  \n \nIn summary, I believe this social attitude is generated due to some enlarged personal acts.

    "Essay": "Some people think that improving people's lives is supposed to be the most vital purpose of science. In general, I support this view.\n \nTo begin with, science is helpful to boost the quality of people's daily lives. With the development of science, there are more and more high-technology products manufactured in recent years, thus providing much convenice to individuals. For example, many products produced based on artificial intelligence technology such as housework robots, auto-driving cars allow people to do things more efficiently with less energy consuming. Therefore, it is very meaningful to use science in improving people's lives.\n \nMeanwhile, science is also significant to help people keep healthy, which is definitely a good way to improve people's lives. A research published in Chinese Daily Newspaper last year showed that there were about 5% more kinds of diseases could be cured by medicine instead of surgery than that in 2019, so that the medical science can decrease pains of the people who is suffering from the diseases, which strongly proved that science played an important role to improve people's lives.\n \nHowever, science has other less important aims at the same time. For instance, some natural science like physics, chemistry, math and so on allow human beings to explore the unknown things in the world. For example, it can make people know why the sun rise from the east and the properties of different kinds of elements, which can help people learn about the world better.\n \nIn conclusion, I basically support the perspective that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives, since it is helpful to boost the quality of people's daily lives and is also significant to help people keep healthy.\n",

    "Essay": "It is often argued whether the process of criminal trials in law courts should be shown to the public. While there are both lots of merits and demerits. In my opinion, I think the disadvantages take the majority of them.\n  \nThere are lots of advantages to show people the process of criminal trials. Firstly, this action can warn people who have the potential criminal think know more about the authority of laws. Also, by showing this, they may abandon their bad habits and it can also improve their responsibility to society. Secondly, it can impart more knowledge about laws to the populace. People who pay attention to the news and events on television can learn the importance of laws. Finally, it can also supervise the lawyers and other workers to execute fairly.\n \nActually, I can understand why some people agree with this action. But I still think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. It is true that this behavior can be benefial to society, however, everyone has their own privacy. No one wants to be entirely exposed to the public. For example, when the personal information or the appearance of a criminal has been shown to the public, it will affect the rest of his life. It will be difficult for the criminal to find a decent job. I believe that we all have made some wrong decisions, and we should give ourselves and other people more chances. What’s more, most people focus on the news, on the one hand, for criminal relatives, it is a kind of psychological wound. On the other hand, it will definitely affect their lives. For instance, the children of criminals may be laughed at by their classmates. Besides,  people will think of them in a biased way.\n \nIn conclusion, we can improve our cognition of laws in many ways.

    "Essay_Prompt": "Multimedia can be seen as offering an alternative or complement to traditional teaching. To what extent do you think multimedia should be incorporated in the classroom?",
    "Essay": "In recent years, multimedia has become a popular trend as a means of teaching. Some people believe that traditional teaching can be replaced by multimedia. While I agree that multimedia has some advantages in teaching, I do not believe that it can be substituted for traditional teaching. And it should be seen as a supplement to traditional teaching. \n\nOne advantage of multimedia in teaching is that it makes lessons more interesting and enjoyable. Students in class can acquire knowledge through Powerpoint with various designs and images instead of traditional teaching methods. As a result, they may not feel bored at the same time deepen their understanding of specific knowledge by watching videos and looking at ppt. Another advantage is that it helps teachers to plan lessons well. Through making ppt after class, teachers can make the best use of their time on class, focusing on the teaching contents, instead of worrying about the time that has been spent on writing on a blackboard. This means that teachers can convey more knowledge to students in a limited time in class.\n\nDespite the fact that multimedia has some merits, its shortcomings cannot be understated. One of the major shortcomings is that it may cause distraction for students. students in a class are easily influenced by colorful pictures or sound effects and become absent-minded. As a result, they are likely to forget the factual contents on ppt. By contrast, in traditional classes, students are often needed to interact with teachers face to face, which will develop good learning habits such as paying attention in class. Another drawback is that relying on multimedia will intensify laziness both for teachers and students. Many teachers choose to download and copy the relevant teaching contents instead of making them on their own and then to simply read it. And many students do not opt to write notes because they can copy the materials offline. But the fact is that simply reading by teachers and listening not writing in time by students will greatly reduce teaching and learning effects. Furthermore, it should be noted that electronic equipment is expensive and fragile. Some schools do not have enough money to pay for projectors and computers.  \n\nFrom the foregoing discussion, given the shortcomings inherent in multimedia, namely which causes distraction, laziness and money problems, it is impossible to replace traditional teaching. Nevertheless, it should be seen as a supplement to conventional teaching.\n\n",

    "Essay": "People seem to have contradictory views concerning: some argue that History is one of the most essential subjects; others, however, consider sciences are more significant than arts. In my opinion, I am more sympathetic to the latter one; believing that in most scenarios, science and technology are more practical.\n \nOn the one hand, I admit the first perspective holds truth. Learning history could increase our cognitive skills and critical thinking skills because history could provide us different perspectives from viewing ancient events. For example, we can understand the benefits and drawbacks the World War Ⅱ. Thus, I acknowledge that the first claim is reasonable in some cases.\n \nOn the other hand, I believe that the second one applies to more circumstances; that is to say, the science curriculum plays a more vital role in education. Students could develop a rational thinking and have the ability to analyze data through learning maths or statistics. Secondly, it is nearly impossible not to face the truth that we are living in a digital era. The advanced technologies revolutionized everything. Only studying sciences can we understand the world and change the future. In contrast, history subjects will make us memorize the past rather than making contribution to our time. Thus, senses are necessary to learn and are more essential than ours.\n \nPersonally, I strongly believe that the second idea applies better to the real world. Although History subject benefits people, in the long term, for the majority of them will find studying sciences are more crucial and learn them in most cases. In conclusion, learning science could improve our society, which is more important in nowadays. \n",

    "Essay": "It is not unusual for the government to cover the spending on citizens’ medical treatments and education, while some argue that the government should not be responsible for such costs. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my point that the government should pay for people’s expenditure on these items.\n\nOne reason why the government should be in charge of the costs is it is a corresponding payment for the tax revenue that it has received from law-abiding citizens. The public pay taxes regularly to the government and it is its obligation to invest in the public services that improve citizens’ well-being of their lives, such as medical system and education, without which they are unable to live healthily or achieve any selfaccomplishment. In addition, the government covering the expenditures of medical care and education is a means of redistribution to avoid the exacerbation of the income disparity. Most people are unable to afford the excessively expensive spending on the medical treatments or the tertiary education, especially for those who are impoverished or disabled. Therefore, the government should offer financial support for those with disabilities or poverty in order to promote social stability.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of this idea argue that the government should invest the tax receipts in other aspects which are of more significance to social development. It is believed that the public’s money should not be distributed to individuals, and it is more acceptable to make investments in projects like scientific researches or the establishments of infrastructures. And paying money to the medical services and education culminates in a budget cut in those projects. Moreover, it would impose an unbearable strain on the government’s financial system and paying for every person’s medical and education expenditure is clearly impossible.\n\nIn conclusion, although some people considered that the government should not take the responsibility to pay for individual’s health care or education, I still believe the government paying such expenditures is a desirable opinion because of its characteristics of fairness and redistribution.\n",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people think it is best to live in a vertical city where there are a lot of tall buildings. Other people think we should live in a horizontal city where there are few tall buildings. Discuss both views and give your opinions.",
    "Essay": "The question of whether people nowadays should live in a district with numerous skyscrapers instead of a region that has a broader horizon remains a subject of heated debate. This essay will discuss both perspectives, although it is my viewpoint that living in a horizontal city is absolutely more desirable for citizens’ health and well-being.\n \nThe prime reason for supporters to advocate the development of vertical cities is the construction of such buildings provides the fully utilization of limited spaces for people. As the process of industrialization deepen, the total amount of natural resources as well as the available land are declining dramatically. High buildings divide the vertical spaces into different sections with various functions, such as the business zone, residential and working spaces, whereas the floor area the building covers remains relatively small compared to its height. Therefore, constructing and moving into skyscrapers has become some architects’ prior solution to make use of the remaining precious land resources.\n \nOn the other hand, others, including me, argue that living in horizontal cities with as the least number of high constructions as possible greatly contributes to people’s life quality as well as their productivity at work. Initially, it is acknowledged that people feel less stressed when surrounded by more natural scenes like mountains or the clear-blue sky. However, cities with a considerable number of skyscrapers are likely to be perceived as concrete forests. People living in such regions often possess a sense of depression due to the limitation of broad sights. Additionally, affected by oppressed feelings, people lacking motivations are unwilling to work efficiently, culminating in significantly detracting from societal productivity. A corresponding example for this is some famous start-up companies tend to have their offices of lower buildings with well-decorated gardens in order to inspire their employees’ creativity by wide visual fields.\n \nIn conclusion, I firmly agree with the opinion that people should live in horizontal cities to improve their standard of living and to ensure the societal productivity, although living in vertical cities may be an advisable strategy to mitigate the problem of land resources’ shortage.\n\n",

    "Essay": "with the acceleration of the pace of modern life, people tend to choose fast food instead of traditional food. Many claim that convenient food would finally take the place of its counterpart, however, I would argue that this is unlikely to happen.\n\nThere may be good arguments for taking pre-prepared food. Since many professionals are busy with their work and endless tasks, would be a convenient and efficient choice. Unlike traditional meals which have to prepare fresh food in advance and have many cooking procedures, most only need to be put in the microwave oven for about serval minutes before people can eat it immediately. However, the drawbacks of the convenient food are also distinct. Opponents claim that pre-prepared food contains too many artificial additives, which would be detrimental to people’s health, especially juveniles. If our daily recipes are dominated by convenient food, many health problems would emerge, such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nMoreover, traditional food and traditional methods of food preparation have their unique cultural value that processed foods could not be replaced. They are an important aspect of our daily lives and could exert great influence on social culture. Firstly, traditional meals could reflect the eating and living habits of a certain community in different areas, and may usually be better to fit local people’s characteristics and preference. Secondly, people used to see traditional food as one of the vivid features of their homelands, so it is not only a kind of food but also a symbol of local culture.

As a result, less money will be remained to other necessary budgets. Therefore, it would finally become a heavy burden for the local economy, the citizens get less social welfare and live more difficult life. \n\nFurthermore, fewer languages bring higher efficiency in modern society. There are thousands of languages using in the world, people need to use different language in different social and business occasions. It is hard for them to master all kinds of languages in the world, both their career and daily life would face more difficulties because of more languages. So it would be easier for them to live if fewer languages remain. \n\nNevertheless, some people argue that the language is a symbol of culture, if we keep on doing nothing to the dying of other languages, our culture would face the same kind of danger later, so we should develop new technologies to protect the dying languages. However, in my opinion, despite the technology is developing fast nowadays, we still need extra attention, extra budget and extra public resources to protect those minority languages, which would still be a heavy burden. But the widespread of the social media would become a special link and easy way to maintain our widely spoken language, for now we needn't any extra effort, only by sending messages, talking and browsing the news using our language on the internet can we easily live our life and reserve our mainstreaming language. \n\nIn conclusion, by reasons of finance, efficiency and technology, I strongly believe that fewer languages in the world would lead an easier life for us. \n",

    "Essay_Prompt": "Some people believe that unpaid community service should be acompulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for acharity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to youngerchildren).\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\n",
    "Essay": "Community service is showing more and more importance in daily life, and some people agree that the unpaid community service should become compulsory program in high school. From my prospective, I totally disagree with this view.\n\nThe argument in favour of setting community service as a compulsory part often depends on the positive society effect it finally brings, which means that only if the department regards the unpaid community service as a compulsory part would high school students be willing to do that. People suppose that most students are the only child of their parents nowadays, in this case, they might be spoiled by their parents, become selfish. For example, they might refused to share their toys, books with other kids since they were young, regarded sharing and helping others as losing their own right. After they grow up, their selfish would also do harm to the society, for the society won't get any progress because of their rejections to help or share with others. Consequently, turning the community service to compulsory part would make effort to force them to learn how to help others, and this would perform a positive part in society development.\n\nHowever, in my view, if students are forced to learn the unpaid community service consistently, they would probably perform much worse than they are supposed to instead. Firstly, personal willingness should be considered as the initial part of doing unpaid community service. Once people are forced to do the service unwillingly, happiness  for themselves and the people who are served would both be extremely cut down, in the end, they show a bad emotion in their daily life, also make，no development to either society or themself. Secondly, compulsory unpaid community service should also be regarded as a waste of time according to contemporary school life as it would occupy too time for other school work. Most students study in the high school in order to gain more knowledge and study living skills to find better job and get better paid in the future. Therefore, the requirement for students to do unpaid community service in their school program is occupying their valuable time to develop skills for themselves future career. As a result, more unreliable unpaid community programs would relate to students’ worse future. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the unpaid community service shouldn't be regarded as a compulsory part of high school programs, because it will not only harm their daily emotion, but also impair their ability to find higher paid career in the future. \n\n",

    "Essay": "Modes of transportation changeing all the time, in contemporary society, some people have problems about whether more construction budget should be paid to railways than roads. From my prospective, I totally agree with the statement that government should spend money on railways.\n\nTo begin with, spending more money on constructing railways increase the efficiency of passengers’ daily commute. Passengers might have been tired of the long-time road commuting every morning, they have to get up early and waste plenty of time waiting their cars passing the crowded roads. High speed railways provide them a more efficient way to commute. Besides, although some people may argue that heavier financial burden will be caused by the railway construction, it’s potential future benefits would be more worthwhile. For more and more people might choose the railways in their daily life because railways are safer, quicker and unobstructed than roads. Consequently, the government would receive more paybacks from the tickets fee spending by passengers. \n\nIn addition, globalization requires more developed and higher speed transportation. However, roads would need more staff and money to   follow-up maintenance, also people might have to spend hours or days on the road if they have to travel to another country. For instance, spending more money constructing the international railways become more necessary. It can transport heavy cargo among different nations easily, promote the economic exchanges, make the international communicating more convenient. As a result, the construction on railways can enrich every country along the route. \n\nIn conclusion, as society is having more changes nowadays, transportation also need promoting. Railways show a quicker and more convenient mode of transportation, so constructing the railways bring benefits to both people’s daily life and the world’s development. Thus, the government should spend money on railways. \n",
